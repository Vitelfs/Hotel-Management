Hotel Management System
I have created a hotel system that has screens for both customers and employees. On the customer screen, the user has the option to make a reservation, 
change password, delete the account, and view their reservations. When the user deletes their account, it also cancels their reservation.

On the employee's view, they have more options such as listing all the hotel rooms, listing all available rooms, listing all registered customers, 
canceling a reservation, and adding a room. All the information is saved in JSON files for future queries. I used two external libraries: 'date' and 'nlohmann'.
